{"cells":[{"source":"![dvd_image](dvd_image.jpg)\n\nA DVD rental company needs your help! They want to figure out how many days a customer will rent a DVD for based on some features and has approached you for help. They want you to try out some regression models which will help predict the number of days a customer will rent a DVD for. The company wants a model which yeilds a MSE of 3 or less on a test set. The model you make will help the company become more efficient inventory planning.\n\nThe data they provided is in the csv file `rental_info.csv`. It has the following features:\n- `\"rental_date\"`: The date (and time) the customer rents the DVD.\n- `\"return_date\"`: The date (and time) the customer returns the DVD.\n- `\"amount\"`: The amount paid by the customer for renting the DVD.\n- `\"amount_2\"`: The square of `\"amount\"`.\n- `\"rental_rate\"`: The rate at which the DVD is rented for.\n- `\"rental_rate_2\"`: The square of `\"rental_rate\"`.\n- `\"release_year\"`: The year the movie being rented was released.\n- `\"length\"`: Lenght of the movie being rented, in minuites.\n- `\"length_2\"`: The square of `\"length\"`.\n- `\"replacement_cost\"`: The amount it will cost the company to replace the DVD.\n- `\"special_features\"`: Any special features, for example trailers/deleted scenes that the DVD also has.\n- `\"NC-17\"`, `\"PG\"`, `\"PG-13\"`, `\"R\"`: These columns are dummy variables of the rating of the movie. It takes the value 1 if the move is rated as the column name and 0 otherwise. For your convinience, the reference dummy has already been dropped.","metadata":{},"id":"b4ae5707-109f-4cd6-8168-88cac0179d6b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n\n# Import any additional modules and start coding below\n\n\"\"\"\nIn this project, you will use regression models to predict the number of days a customer rents DVDs for.\n\nAs with most data science projects, you will need to pre-process the data provided, in this case, a csv file called rental_info.csv.
